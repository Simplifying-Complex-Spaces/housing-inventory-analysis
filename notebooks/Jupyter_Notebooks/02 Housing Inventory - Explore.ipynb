The only real difference of note is that the mortgage rate is actually slightly **lower** than the prime rate. At the surface, this does not make great sense as many of the advertisements for lending (credit cards, in particular) talk in terms of the prime rate plus a percentage. This is due to mortgage rates for 30-year fixed rate mortgages (like we are working to explain in this analysis) are to the 10-year Treasury bond rate.[8]\n"
